# Cryptocurrencies

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning on Crypto dataset to analyze what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for the new investment portfolio Accountability Accounting,  a prominent investment bank, is planning to offer to its customers. The analysis steps cover how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA. 

The data was processed to fit the machine learning models. As there was no known output, unsupervised machine learning tecchniques were used for this analysis. To group the cryptocurrencies, a clustering algorithm was used. 

The analysis consists of four technical steps:
- Preprocessing the Data for PCA
- Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
